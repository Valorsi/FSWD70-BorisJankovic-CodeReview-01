    <p class="lyrics"> Look, if you had mom's spaghetti,<br>

                Would you capture it or just let it slip?<br>
                Yo<br>

                His palms spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti<br>
                There's vomit on his sweater spaghetti, mom's spaghetti<br>
                He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti to<br>
                drop bombs,<br>
                But he keeps on spaghetti what he wrote down,<br>
                The whole crowd goes spaghetti<br>
                He opens his mouth, but spaghetti won't come out<br>
                He's choking how, everybody's joking now<br>
                spaghetti run out, time's up, over, bloah!<br>
                Snap back to spaghetti, Oh there goes spaghetti<br>
                Oh, there goes spaghetti, bloah<br>
                He's so mad, but he won't give up spaghetti, no.<br>

                He won't have it, he knows he keeps on forgetting<br>
                that mom's spaghetti's dope<br>
                He knows that but he's broke<br>
                He's so stagnant, he knows<br>
                When he goes back to his mom's spaghetti, that's when it's<br>
                Back to the lab again, yo<br>
                This whole spaghetti<br>
                He better go capture spaghetti and hope it don't pass him<br>

                You better lose yourself in mom's spaghetti, it's ready<br>
                you better never let it go(go)<br>
                You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo<br>
                You better lose yourself in mom's spaghetti, it's ready<br>

                you better never let it go(go)<br>
                You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo<br>
                (You better)<br>

                The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<br>
                mom's spaghetti's mine for the taking<br>

                Make me spaghetti, as we move toward a new world order<br>
                A normal sweater is boring, but mom's spaghetti's close to<br>
                post mortem
                It only grows harder, spaghetti grows hotter<br>
                He vomits all over. spaghetti's all on him<br>
                Coast to coast shows, he blows his own daughter<br>
                He only grows harder, only grows hotter<br>
                He goes home and barely knows his own mom's spaghetti<br>
                there's vomit on his mom's spaghetti<br>
                His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold spaghetti<br>
                They moved on to the next schmoe who flows man<br>
                he knows his palms are sweaty ope hes calm and ready ope<br>
                and unfolds I suppose it's old spaghetti<br>
                chewed up and spit out he's chokin now<br>

                You better lose yourself in mom's spaghetti, it's ready<br>
                you better never let it go(go)<br>
                You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo<br>
                You better lose yourself in mom's spaghetti, it's ready<br>
                you better never let it go(go)<br>

                No more games, I'ma change what you call spaghetti<br>
                Tear this motherfucking roof off like two mom's spaghettis<br>

                I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>
                spaghetti<br>
                chewed up and spit out and there's vomit on his sweater<br>
                But I kept chewin and stepped right into the next cypher<br>
                Hold your nose cause here goes the damn diaper<br>
                All the vomit inside amplified by the fact<br>
                That I keep on forgetting to make spaghetti<br>
                And I can't provide the right type of spaghetti for my<br>
                family<br>

                Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy spaghetti<br>
                And it's no movie, there's no mom's spaghetti, this is my<br>
                life<br>
                And these palms are so sweaty, and i'm so hard<br>
                My seed's escaping through this hole that is gaping<br>
                caught up between being a father and a prima donna<br>
                Baby vomit's on his sweater already<br>
                Mom's spaghetti he's nervous<br>

                bloah another day of monotony<br>
                Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a mom<br>
                I've got to formulate spaghetti or I end up in jail or shot<br>
                spaghetti is my only motherfucking option, vomit's not<br>
                Mom, I love you, but this vomit's got to go<br>
                ope ope, led de dome de dome led de dome de dome<br>
                So here I go it's my shot.<br>
                this may be the only mom's spaghetti that I got<br>
                You better lose yourself in mom's spaghetti, it's ready<br>
                you better never let it go(go)<br>
                You only get one spaghetti, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                cause spaghetti comes once in a lifetime yo<br>
                You better lose yourself in mom's spaghetti, it's ready<br>
